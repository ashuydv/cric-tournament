                  RunBhumi is not just a platform ‚Äî it is a revolution in motion. Born from a bold vision to break the boundaries of access, geography, and privilege, RunBhumi is India's largest and most ambitious cricket talent discovery initiative. We are proud to be the world's first-ever televised individual cricket talent hunt, offering a rare blend of grassroots outreach, professional training, and global media exposure.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground md:text-lg">
                  At its core, RunBhumi is a mission-driven ecosystem that scouts, nurtures, and launches young cricketing talent from every walk of life ‚Äî from metro cities to the remotest villages, and from the heart of Bharat to Indian-origin communities overseas. We exist for the dreamers who've never had a fair shot ‚Äî and we exist to turn those dreams into careers.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground md:text-lg">
                  Through a nationwide network of on-ground trials in 36+ cities, we identify passionate, high-potential players who may never have had the platform to be seen. Shortlisted candidates then undergo an intensive 45-day Gurukul-style training camp, rooted in Indian traditions and guided by international legends and spiritual mentors. From there, they progress to our grand finale ‚Äî a televised league featuring 12 teams, 150+ players, and ex-international cricketers as mentors and co-players.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground md:text-lg">
                  RunBhumi doesn't just stop at selection ‚Äî we focus on holistic transformation. Each player experiences professional coaching, character-building mentorship, wellness and yoga practices, and real-time game exposure on national television. This multi-dimensional journey ensures that our players are not only great cricketers ‚Äî but strong, grounded individuals prepared for the pressures of the professional sports world.
